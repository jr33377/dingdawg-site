# Shopify API Connectivity Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the provided Shopify credentials and testing various API endpoints, I have determined that **the provided credentials are not valid Shopify API credentials**. Instead, they appear to be affiliate reference IDs used for tracking affiliate commissions on Shopify's website.

## Findings

### 1. Credential Analysis

**Provided Credentials:**
- `SHOPIFY_ACCOUNT_SID=IRcZcymc9wen6420145akTB5xMpVxcTCR1`
- `SHOPIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=J5KWGwX5dDebRJ.egZpKYasL.UMUSCRs`

**Actual Purpose:**
- `IRcZcymc9wen6420145akTB5xMpVxcTCR1` is used as an affiliate reference ID in URLs like:
  `https://www.shopify.com/?ref=IRcZcymc9wen6420145akTB5xMpVxcTCR1`
- This is found throughout the `/tools/index.html` file as affiliate links
- These are NOT API credentials for accessing Shopify's REST or GraphQL APIs

### 2. API Testing Results

**Tests Conducted:**
- ✅ Researched current Shopify API documentation (2024-10 version)
- ✅ Created automated testing scripts (Node.js and HTML)
- ✅ Tested multiple potential shop domains
- ✅ Verified authentication header requirements

**API Response Analysis:**
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid shop domains
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid access tokens on existing shops
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Shop redirects (not API related)

**Key Technical Findings:**
- Shopify API requires `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header
- Current API version is 2024-10
- Base URL format: `https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-10/`
- Product endpoint: `/products.json`

### 3. Correct Shopify API Requirements

To successfully connect to Shopify's API, you need:

1. **Shop Domain**: Your actual Shopify store domain (e.g., `your-store.myshopify.com`)
2. **Access Token**: A valid API access token generated from:
   - Shopify Admin Dashboard (for private apps)
   - OAuth flow (for public apps)
   - Shopify Partner Dashboard

### 4. Created Testing Tools

**Files Created:**
1. `/test_shopify_api.js` - Node.js testing script
2. `/test_shopify_api.html` - Browser-based testing interface
3. This analysis report

**Testing Capabilities:**
- Shop information retrieval (`/shop.json`)
- Product listing (`/products.json`)
- Product count (`/products/count.json`)
- Error handling and response analysis
- Rate limiting detection

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Obtain Valid API Credentials:**
   - Log into your Shopify Admin Dashboard
   - Navigate to Apps > App and sales channel settings
   - Create a private app or use existing API credentials
   - Generate an Admin API access token with required scopes

2. **Identify Your Shop Domain:**
   - Your shop domain format: `{your-shop-name}.myshopify.com`
   - This is visible in your Shopify admin URL

3. **Configure Proper Environment Variables:**
   ```env
   SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN=your-shop-name.myshopify.com
   SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_access_token_here
   ```

### API Permissions Required

For product data access, ensure your API credentials have these scopes:
- `read_products` - To fetch product information
- `read_inventory` - To access inventory data (if needed)
- `read_orders` - To access order data (if needed)

### Testing Steps

1. Update the test scripts with your actual shop domain
2. Replace the access token with your valid API token
3. Run the Node.js test: `node test_shopify_api.js`
4. Or use the HTML interface for browser-based testing

## Conclusion

The current credentials (`IRcZcymc9wen6420145akTB5xMpVxcTCR1` and `J5KWGwX5dDebRJ.egZpKYasL.UMUSCRs`) are **not valid Shopify API credentials**. They appear to be affiliate tracking codes used for commission purposes on Shopify's marketing website.

To successfully access Shopify's API and retrieve product data, you must:
1. Obtain proper API credentials from your Shopify admin
2. Use your actual shop domain
3. Configure the correct authentication headers

The testing infrastructure has been created and is ready to use once you have the correct credentials.

## Next Steps

1. Access your Shopify admin dashboard
2. Generate proper API credentials
3. Update the test scripts with correct credentials
4. Re-run the connectivity tests
5. Begin actual product data integration
