If You register any Products for sale via the ClickBank Services, You agree, acknowledge, represent, and warrant that:

 

a. All Products You register for sale via the ClickBank Services must be approved by ClickBank prior to You being able to sell the Products through the ClickBank Services. In certain circumstances, ClickBank may require You to modify Your Products prior to being approved or prohibit Your Products from being sold via the ClickBank Services, in ClickBank's sole discretion. ClickBank’s approval or modification of a Product is not an endorsement of the Product or of any modification thereof, and ClickBank is not liable thereof.

 

b. All Products You register for sale via the ClickBank Services, and the offering and sale thereof, via the ClickBank Services, comply with all of Your country's laws, all laws of any country to which Your Product may be shipped, and all applicable U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, and any other laws applicable to the Product or Promotion.

 

c. Your Products do not involve downloading software on the computer of a person or entity purchasing a Product (the "Purchaser") unless a purchase is completed or You provide the Purchaser a clear and conspicuous disclosure describing all of the software being downloaded and its functionality, and You obtain express consent prior to any such downloads.

 

d. Without further conditions or limitations, You authorize ClickBank to list any Product You register for sale via the ClickBank Services in the online, searchable marketplace of Products made available via the ClickBank Services (the "ClickBank Marketplace"); and make it available for sale to Purchasers and/or for the persons and/or entities that Promote the Products made available via the ClickBank Marketplace ("Affiliates") at the price solely determined by ClickBank ("Retail Price") after taking into consideration Your suggestions regarding such Retail Price, including any applicable sales tax.

 

e. You will provide in an accurate and complete manner all information necessary for ClickBank to comply with the Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act,5 U.S.C. §45(f) (the "INFORM Consumers Act") and update such information as necessary for ClickBank to remain in compliance with the INFORM Consumers Act.

 

f. You will provide and maintain valid email address(es), and update such address(es) as necessary, for Purchasers or ClickBank to send inquiries and You will receive such emails and provide a reply by end of the following business day. Purchasers and ClickBank must also be able to receive a non-automated response within one business day, when necessary.

 

g. You will notify ClickBank of any regulatory or legal complaints, or threats of such complaints, that You receive in connection with or in relation to a Product within two business days of Your receipt of such complaint. You shall assist ClickBank, at Your sole cost and expense, in taking any necessary or appropriate actions reasonably requested by ClickBank to respond to and/or resolve such complaints.

 

h. ClickBank will collect and remit state or local transfer taxes for any retail transaction (including but not limited to sales or use tax) where it believes it is legally required to do so. Where ClickBank does not collect and remit state or local transfer taxes on a transaction, You may have the legal obligation to pay such taxes. Such obligation may arise as a result of Your existing or past physical contacts with a state (including but not limited to Your provision of a "drop ship" delivery of the physical Product to a buyer located in a state). You may wish to consult a tax professional to determine if You will have this type of obligation in any particular state. You agree that if such an obligation arises with respect to any particular state, You will be solely responsible for the timely payment of such tax and any interest or penalties.

 

i. If and to the extent You use third parties to provide Products, You and such third parties must be in compliance with all terms of this Agreement, and You are responsible for all acts and omissions of such third party.

 

j. All sellers must include the required disclaimers and comply with the requirements set forth at the following links:https://support.clickbank.com/hc/articles/220199588-Product-Guidelines (the “Product Guidelines") and https://support.clickbank.com/hc/en-us/articles/220376687-Promotional-Guidelines (the “Promotional Guidelines”).

 

k. You will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

 

l. You will establish an appropriate return, replacement and/or cancellation policy for Your Products ("Seller Return Policy"). Your Seller Return Policy must fall within the range of "no refunds" to allowing refunds or replacements up to sixty (60) days after the date of purchase (i.e., a 30-day refund policy or a 45-day refund policy would each be acceptable, if appropriate). If You believe that a Seller Return Policy longer than sixty (60) days after the date of purchase is appropriate for Your Products, ClickBank will review such a request, and in its sole discretion, may allow an extended Seller Return Policy. You can only provide such an extended Seller Return Policy with ClickBank's written consent.

 

m. You will ensure that the Seller Return Policy is clearly and conspicuously posted for customers to review prior to purchasing Your Products.

 

n. ClickBank reserves the right to alter or override Your Seller Return Policy if You abuse ClickBank's flexible Return and Cancellation Policy, if Your Seller Return Policy is not appropriate for the Product(s), if the returned or charged back sales (defined in the Accounting Policy) are excessive, or for any other reason ClickBank deems appropriate, in its sole discretion.
